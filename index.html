    <pre>A paragraph is a series of sentences that              are organized and coherent, and are all related to a single topic. Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few            sentences should be organized into paragraphs. This is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an essay begin and          end, and thus help the reader see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points</pre>
